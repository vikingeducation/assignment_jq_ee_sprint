## The Form Validation

1. When you type in a field you can see how many remaining characters you
   have left
2. When you type your password confirmation you receive feedback until the
   both passwords match
3. When you click submit you receive an error if any of the following
   validations are not met:
    - Text-field 4-32 characters
    - Text area 4-140 characters
    - Password/confirmation 6-16 characters

## The Dropdown Menu

Meant to replicate the functionality of a ```<select>``` form

Fulfills the following requirements:
1. The top-level element starts out blank
2. It contains at least 3 example elements
3. It should smoothly slide open and closed
4. The sub-elements should change background color when the menu is opened and
   they are hovered over
5. The sub-elements should be clickable.  When clicked, the menu closes and that
   element becomes the top-level element to indicate it has been selected

## The Photo Tagging Box

Meant to simulate photo-tagging features present on popular social media sites

Fulfills the following requirements:
1. When your cursor moves over the photo, it should be in the center of a square
   "targeting" outline.  This outline should not show unless you're hovering
over the photo
2. When you click, the targetting outline becomes fixed at that location and a
   simple drop-down menu slides down below it
3. If you click away from the dropdown, this should cancel the tagging process.
4. If you select a name from the list, that name should be displayed next to the
   new tag box
5. Previous tags should remain on the screen until the browser reloads and
   everything is reset
