# Practice with Events and Effects
=============================================


In this assignment, I applied some of the DOM effects:
- form valuation - built text fields with functionality similar to the one in Twitter - showing character counter, also providing feedback if confirmation password is the same as original, or it's not too short...
- drop-down menu  - a simple form-style dropdown menu using method of my choice. Very basic styling. This is meant to replicate the functionality of a <select> without using <select> tags.
- photo tagger - replicating Facebook tagging boxes; when you hover your mouse over a photo, it brings up a square "Photo tagging box" which allows you to select who is present in the photo from your list of friends.
